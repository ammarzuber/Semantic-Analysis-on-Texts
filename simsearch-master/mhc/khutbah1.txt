“DEFENDING THE COUNTRY IS A RELIGIOUS DUTY” 

 
 
Dear blessed Muslims, 
 
 Let us strive to increase our taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta„aala by fulfilling all of His Commands and avoiding all of His prohibitions. May we all attain barakah (blessings) in our lives and bestowed with Allah’s protection in this world and the Hereafter. 
 
 Today I will deliver a khutbah titled “DEFENDING THE COUNTRY IS A RELIGIOUS DUTY.” 
 
Respected Muslims, 
 
 Verily, peace and harmony within a nation does not come about without effort. Instead, it is the very fruit of the blood, sweat, and tears shed by our freedom fighters that we deem as warriors. 
 
 Warriors’ Day that is commemorated every year is truly meaningful for us as individuals that yearn for peace. The nation’s warriors that comprise of those from the Malaysian Army, the Royal Malaysian Police, and other national security agencies are greatly appreciated and remembered for their services. Not forgetting, our freedom fighters that triggered the spirit of heroism in fighting off the colonialists on our land such as Dato’ Bahaman, Tok Janggut, Mat Kilau, Leftenan Adnan, and others that will never be forgotten. 
 
 The sacrifices of the warriors are highly revered especially when their struggle is met with martyrdom. Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta„aala mentions in verse 154 of soorah alBaqarah:

            .                                                                                                                                                                 .

“And do not say about those who are killed in the way of Allah, “They are dead.” Rather, they are alive, but you perceive [it] not.” 
 
This verse explains that when the Muslim ummah undertake jihaad in the path of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta„aala and gets killed, then they are not deemed as dead, rather they are alive with full honor in the Sight of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta„aala. They are granted with a life that is much more privileged compared to others. 
 
Dearest audience, 
 
 In preserving peace within the nation, we must always remain prepared in facing the enemy, according to our ability, as Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta„aala mentions in verse 60 of soorah al-Anfaal: 
 
  
 
“And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom Allah knows...” 
 
 According to Tafseer al-Maraaghiy, Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta„aala commands the believers to make the necessary preparation for battle so as to ward off the enemy’s attack. Such preparations can be made in two different scenarios: 
 
First: Preparing all sorts of military strength needed, suitable for the time and place such as manufacturing weapons, war aircrafts, explosives, tanks, submarines, and others. Likewise, acquiring knowledge in various fields of expertise and developing the necessary equipment. 
 
Second: Placing the defense forces at harbors and along the border for these are strategic entry points for the enemies to encroach upon our nation. The wisdom is so that the people will always have an army protecting them when the enemy makes a sudden attack. 
 
This indicates that Islam deem as grave importance regarding the matter of national security by ensuring that the borders are always guarded using modern weaponry or that which is suitable with the changing of time. 
 
Blessed Muslims, 
 
 History has shown the true valor of the Muslim army from its glorious days up until the Ottoman caliphate in Turkey that is truly astounding. The prowess of Sultan Muhammad al-Fatih and his army should be truly emulated. In the hadeeth of ‘Abdullah bin Bishr radiyAllaahu „anh, Rasulullah  ﷺ said: 
 
            .                                                                                                                                                                 .

 “You will conquer Constantinople. The best commander is its commander and the best army is its army.” 
 
 Their traits as warriors having solid imaan (faith), tawaddu„ (humility), intelligence, and courage had enabled them to lead the Muslim army until they were able to conquer Constantinople from the Romans. Such victory had opened up the door for the spread of Islam into Europe. Among his words to his army on the 53rd day of siege were: “O my army! I am ready to die in the path of Allah. Whoever wants to attain martyrdom, then come follow me!” 
 
Among the contributing factors to the victory of the Muslim army in that battle is closely intertwined with their imaan unto Allah, self-identity, loyalty to their leader, and willingness to sacrifice for the sake of the religion, society, and nation as a whole. 
 
According to Dr Yusuf al-Qaradawi in his book “al-Imaan wal-Haayah”, among the pillars of strength for the believers are full reliance upon Allah Ta„aala and unwavering certainty that Allah is always with them wherever they are. They would participate in a battle not because of their whims and desire, not because of personal interest, and not to persecute and infringe upon the rights of others. They are not afraid of their enemy, and moreover, it only makes them stronger upon seeing the large number of enemies they would have to face, as in the Battle of al-Ahzaab (the Trench) in the 5th Hijri year. Such is the greatness of the warriors of previous generations who would prioritize upon the firmness of imaan and „aqeedah in defending the nation. 
 
Blessed audience, 
 
 To end the khutbah, let us altogether internalize upon several suggestions, namely: 
 
1. The Muslim ummah must have full certainty that defending the sovereignty of the nation is a religious duty that will be rewarded with tremendous rewards in the Hereafter. 
 
2. Our national gladiators must equip themselves with firm imaan and deep love for the country based on the principles of fighting in the path of Allah. 
 
3. The Muslim ummah must always unite in strengthening true brotherhood so as to uphold the shi„aar (symbols) of Islam and defend the religion, citizen, and nation. 
 
4. The Muslim ummah must supplicate for national warriors who have returned to their Creator so that their souls will attain rahmah (mercy) and forgiveness. For those that are valiantly waving the banner of struggle, we supplicate so that they will always remain istiqaamah (steadfast) in defending every inch of our homeland.  .   

THE SECOND KHUTBAH 

 Dear blessed audience, 
 
Once again, I would like to remind all of us to always have the taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta„aala and realize that Islam teaches us to remain moderate in every actions and deeds. As Muslims, we are to manifest noble akhlaaq, having utmost personality and attitude for Rasulullah  ﷺ was sent to perfect akhlaaq and as mercy for the entire mankind and the worlds. Therefore, let us always increase our salawaat and salaam upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta„aala mentions: 
 
“Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace.” (al-Ahzaab 33:56)            .              .                     .   . ‌َ ‌ِّ ا لَ سَ و ِّ لَ ص َّمُهَّلل ىَ ٍ لَ ع ْم دَّمَحُ ا م َهَلاْىَمَ ْ ا و َهِدَُِّس ًَ ع َّمُهَّ الل َضْ از َ و َ ين ِ لَ سْسُْ الْ ِدَُِّس .َ نْيِعَمْجَ ؤ ِهِاج َّ ـٍِّ زُذَ و ِهِ اج َ وْ ش

O Allah, open up our hearts in performing the five daily prayers, fulfilling zakaat through Lembaga Zakat Selangor (Selangor Zakaat Board), making waqf and infaaq of our wealth to Perbadanan Wakaf Negeri Selangor (Selangor Waqf Corporation), and Tabung Amanah Pembangunan Islam Selangor (Islamic Development Trust Fund of Selangor).

            Khutbah Jumaat  27 Julai  2018M / 14 Zulkaedah  1439H:  “Mempertahankan Negara Tuntutan Agama”. 

 “WELCOME, O DHUL-HIJJAH” 
 
	
I remind myself and respected audience to altogether strive in increasing our taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala, by performing all of His Commands and avoiding all of His prohibitions. For verily, the successful ones in the Hereafter are those having utmost taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala during their worldly life. 
 
With the coming of the noble month of Dhul-Hijjah, let us ponder upon today’s khutbah titled “WELCOME, O DHUL-HIJJAH.” 
 
Blessed audience, 
 
Dhul-Hijjah is among the greatest and special months in the Sight of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. It is from among the four sacred (haraam) months in Islam, as it was mentioned by Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala in verse 36 of soorah at-Tawbah: 
 

“Indeed, the number of months with Allah is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allah [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred...” 
 
The four sacred months mentioned in this verse were explained by the Prophet ﷺ in his narration:  
 
“Time has completed its cycle and has come to the state of the day when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year consists of twelve months of which four are inviolable; three of them consecutive - Dhul-Qa„dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram and Rajab, the month of Mudar (tribe), which comes between Jumada and Sha„baan.” 
                                                 
1 al-Hajj 22:32 
                                                        (al-Bukhaari and Muslim)  
Dear blessed audience, 
The nobility and glory of Dhul-Hijjah can be seen with the legislation of the ‘ibaadah (worship) of hajj by Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. The ‘ibaadah of hajj is a symbol of servitude that is filled with devotion and the utmost sacrifice by the slave to Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala.  
 
As for us who will not be performing the ‘ibaadah of hajj this year, we are highly encouraged to indulge in worship in the month of Dhul-Hijjah with various righteous deeds, especially in the first ten days. Narrated ibn ‘Abbaas radiyAllaahu ‘anhuma that the Prophet ﷺ said: مَِا مِنْ ؤَاامٍ، الْعَمَلُ ال اصالِحُ فِيهَا ؤَحَبُّ إِلَى الالهِ، مِنْ هَرِهِ الًَْْاامِِ. ِ
“There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days (the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah).” 
   (al-Bukhaari) 
 ibn ‘Umar radiyAllaahu ‘anhuma reported that the Prophetﷺ said: 
ِ
“There are no days greater and more beloved to Allah than these ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, so increase in them your declaration of the Oneness of Allah (tahleel), your exaltation of him (takbeer), and your praise of him (tahmeed).” 
        (Ahmad) 
 
Respected guests of Allah, 
 
Therefore, righteous deeds that are highly recommended for us to indulge in this month is to increase our fasting especially on the Day of ‘Arafah. 
 
Verily, the virtue of fasting especially on the Day of ‘Arafah is based on the hadeeth of Abu Qataadah radiyAllaahu ‘anhu, where Rasulullah ﷺ said: 
 صُِ َامُ ًَىْمِ عَسَفَتَ، ؤَحْدَسِبُ عَلَى اللهِ ؤَنْ ُكَفِّسَ ال اسىَتَ االتِي قَبْلَهُ، وَاالتِي بَعْدَهُِ. 
 
“Fast the Day of „Arafah, for indeed I anticipate that Allah will forgive (the sins) of the year after it, and the year before it.” 
(Muslim) 
 
Aside from that, we are highly encouraged to increase in giving sadaqah (charity), making dhikr (remembrance of Allah), tahleel, istighfaar, and perform tawbah (repentance) to Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala, in addition to avoiding all forms of disobedience and sinning. Committing disobedience and sinful acts will cause us to further distance ourselves from the love and mercy of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala.  
 
In addition, for those that have the intention of offering ud-hiyah (sacrifice), when entering Dhul-Hijjah, the sunnah is for them to not pluck or cut their hair or nails until the animals have been slaughtered. 
 
In the hadeeth of Umm Salamah radiyAllaahu ‘anha: the Prophet said: 
 

“Whoever sees the crescent moon of Dhul-Hijjah and intends to offer sacrifice, let him not cut anything from his hair and nails.”  
(Muslim) 
 
Dear beloved audience, 
 
To end the khutbah today, let us pay extra attention to the following matters: 
 
1.	The Muslim ummah must have certainty that honoring and upholding the great days of Islam including the month of Dhul-Hijjah is from the manifestation of imaan and taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. 
 
2.	The Muslim ummah is called upon to fill its Dhul-Hijjah with various righteous deeds for its rewards are multiplied manifold. 
 
3.	The Muslim ummah must always have sincerity (ikhlaas) and hasten in performing righteous deeds so that those deeds will attain the rewards and pleasure of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. 
 
[all that is] good. Wherever you may be, Allah will bring you forth [for judgment] all together. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.” 
 (al-Baqarah 2:148)

 “ADDRESSING THE LGBT ISSUE” 
 

Dear respected audience, 	 
 
Let us altogether strive to increase our taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala by fulfilling all of His Commands and avoiding all of His prohibitions.  
 
On this noble Friday, let us listen and ponder upon a khutbah titled “ADDRESSING 
THE LGBT ISSUE.” 
 
In recent days, we have been witnessing one perverted movement that truly violates Islamic teachings, becoming bold and brazen in coming forth to demand the rights for its members. This movement, using the acronym LGBT that stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender, is causing grave worries for it is feared that it can influence and permeate through the Muslim minds on a grand scale if it is not curbed and prevented. 
 
In terms of definition, Lesbian refers to a woman who has same-sex relationship with another woman. Gay refers to a man who has same-sex relationship with another man. Bisexual refers to a man that has sexual relationship with another man and woman. Similarly, for a woman that has sexual relationship with another woman and man. While Transgender refers to a man who deem himself as a woman, and a woman that deem herself as a man, and in some cases they would change their gender by undergoing a surgery. 
 
From the historical perspectives, the lifestyle of LGBT is not something new. It has long existed since the time of Prophet Lot „Alayhis-Salaam, as mentioned by Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala in verses 80-81 of soorah al-A„raaf, recited earlier in the khutbah, what means:   
 
“And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, “Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.”” 
 
Hence, in Islam, LGBT is an act of transgression that is accursed and vehemently prohibited by Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala, whether committed in private or openly. LGBT is an act deemed as a major sin and accursed that truly violates the sanctity of a human being, for it denies the rights to intimate relationship through a marriage that is legitimate and recognized by the Shara‘ as husband and wife. 
 
Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala mentions in verses 165-166 of soorah ashShu„araa‟: 
 
 
 “Do you approach males among the worlds? And leave what your Lord has created for you as mates? But you are a people transgressing.” 
 
In a hadeeth that expounds the evil of LGBT, Abu Hurayrah radiyAllaahu ‘anh narrated that Rasulullah ﷺ said:  
 
“Four types of people get up in the morning while they are under the wrath of 
Allah and they sleep in the night while they are under the displeasure of Allah.” He 
(ﷺ) was asked: “Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?” The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, “Those men who try to resemble women and those women who try to resemble men, those men who have sex with men, and those who have sex with animals.” 
(at-Tabraani and al-Bayhaqi) 
 
This lewd act is not only prohibited and banned (declared as haraam), but any measures or means that would lead to that path is also impermissible, as Rasulullah ﷺ had firmly asserted in a narration: 
 
“A man should not see the private parts of another man, and a woman should not see the private parts of another woman, and a man should not lie with another man under one covering, and a woman should not lie with another woman under one covering.” 
 (Muslim) 
 
Respected audience, 
 
 According to the statistics furnished by the Ministry of Women, Family, and Community Development for 2013, it was discovered that 3% of the Malaysian population is involved with LGBT, which translates to approximately 173,000 individuals. 
 
 Such staggering figure would definitely have continued to rise from year to year if effective actions and proactive measures are not taken by relevant authorities in handling this matter in an effective manner.    
 
 For our very own information, based on the report from the HIV/STI Sector, Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia, a total of 3,347 HIV cases were recorded in 2017 and from that amount, a total of 1,697 cases are related to individuals that are involved in unnatural sexual habits such as homosexual and bisexual relationships (LGBT). 
 
 Aside from that, the transmission of such virus amongst homosexuals and bisexuals are on the increase from year to year, with 63 cases in the year 2000 to 1,553 cases in 2016, and 1,697 cases just last year. 
 
 In administering the issue of LGBT, JAIS (Selangor Islamic Religious Department) specifically through its Enforcement Management Division has taken action based on the provisions of the existing Sharee‘ah Criminal Offense Enactment 1995 such as Section 27 for the offense in same-sex relationship, Section 28 for the offense in unnatural sexual relationship, and Section 30 for the offense of a man behaving like a woman. 
 
 For the period of 2015 until 2018, a total of 30 complaints were recorded in relation to the various offenses mentioned just now, of which, a total of 7 arrests had been made by JAIS enforcement officers. 
 
 Even though the number of complaints and arrests relating to LGBT are not high, it does not necessarily mean that these immoral acts can be taken lightly and heedlessly. An offense remains an offense regardless of how major or minor it may be. 
 
This is because if this cursed act and major sin continues to remain and become rampant, then it is not impossible for Allah to send down torment and punishment as it was done upon the people of Prophet Lot ‘Alayhis-Salaam. Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala mentions in verses 82-83 of soorah Hood: 
 

“So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, [which were]. Marked from your Lord. And Allah’s punishment is not from the wrongdoers [very] far.”  
 
Therefore, LGBT groups are advised to fully regret and repent and thoroughly ponder upon the actual purpose of life in this world, as Allah mentions in verse 162 of soorah al-An„aam: 
 
 
“Say, “Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds.”” 
 
In providing welfare and affection to those within the LGBT community whom have fully regretted and repented, the Selangor Fatwa Committee‟s meeting that took place on the 14th of May 2012 has decided in its fatwa pertaining to zakaat recipient (asnaf) of arRiqaab (freeing slaves or captives) category to also include this very group. In this particular fatwa, it was stated that those that have chosen to return to “normalcy” are eligible to receive ar-Riqaab zakaat aid through the intermediation of any Islamic institutions or NGOs that are involved in the recovery program of LGBT individuals, so that they can return to having a complete life that adheres to sound Islamic teachings. 
 
Dear blessed audience, 
 
In concluding the khutbah, let us internalize upon the following suggestions: 
 
1.	The Muslim ummah must have full certainty that Allah is All Merciful towards His slaves having imaan (belief) and Allah is very displeased with His slaves that transgresses. 
 
2.	It is waajib (obligatory) upon the Muslim ummah to feel disgusted and irritated upon any acts or deeds that are accursed by Allah and His Messenger. 
 
3.	The Muslim ummah must strive its utmost in aiding those that truly intend to return to the path that is pleasing to Allah. 
	
“And those who are patient, seeking the countenance of their Lord, and establish prayer and spend from what We have provided for them secretly and publicly and prevent evil with good - those will have the good consequence of [this] home.”

 “LIBERALISM CORRUPTS THE „AQEEDAH” 
 

Dear blessed Muslims, 	 
 
 I remind myself and call upon beloved Muslims to strive to increase our imaan and taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala by abiding and fulfilling all of His Commands and avoiding all of His prohibitions. May we always remain upon the correct ‘aqeedah and not become entangled with the deviants, whom only further deviates. 
 
Today, I will be delivering a khutbah titled “LIBERALISM CORRUPTS THE 
„AQEEDAH.” 
 
Dear blessed audience, 
 
Liberalism is an ideology that demands for the freedom of thought without limitation and rejects the principle of truth in Islam, while opting for the easiest way in religion. 
 
It is through liberalism that the Muslim minds have been molded with the mixture of freedom without limit, which is the freedom to do anything without restriction, censure or discrimination, deemed as the fundamental freedom. If restricted, obstructed or persecuted, they would be quick to cry to the entire world claiming that their freedom has been violated. 
 
Those fighting for liberal ideology would often claim that Islam is rigid, retards and limits progress, and they even attempted to instill fear within the masses by denying the implementation of Islamic laws, claiming that it is unconstitutional for it is unjust, oppressive, and unsuitable to be implemented where there is a diversity of ethnicity and religion, while Islam is a complete religion, divinely revealed by Allah Subhaanahu 
                                                 
1 al-Baqarah 2:120 
Wata‘aala whom is All-Knowing. Islam is all encompassing, which includes legislations and laws that govern the lives of humans in all aspects for their well-being.   
 
Blessed Muslims, 
 
In the following, I will attempt to explain in details the various forms of danger within liberalism upon the sanctity of the ‘aqeedah of the Muslim ummah:  
 
First: Liberalism alludes to the understanding that all religions are the same. 
 
Those subscribing to liberalism and pluralism actually reject the established truthfulness of Islam and instead state that all religions are the same, for they all advocate good. They claim that if a non-Muslim is granted the liberty to change religion, then the Muslim must be granted the same freedom to apostate.  
 
Such ideology is very dangerous and detrimental for Islam is the only religion that is pleasing to Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. Moreover, Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala had firmly decreed that no other religion will be accepted save Islam, and whoever chooses other than Islam, then they will be among the losers in the Hereafter. Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala mentions in verse 85 of soorah Aal-‘Imraan: 
 
   
“And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.” 
 
Second: Liberalism promotes secularism. 
 
The danger of secularism upon the ‘aqeedah is that someone becomes fully 
convinced that religion is purely a personal matter and that religion is restricted to matters pertaining religious rituals alone. The secularists claim that religion is contradictory to science, just as revelation is contradictory to the intellect. For this very reason, they deem that mankind does not need to submit to religious rulings. They proclaim that ribaa (usury) is permissible and that it contributes to the nation’s economic growth. Similarly, they claimed that it is the rights of the individual to consume intoxicants and that khalwah (close proximity between non-mahram) is personal rights that cannot be infringed upon. Such ideology is very harmful and destructive to the ‘aqeedah of a Muslim for Islam is a perfect way of life. 
 
Third: Liberalism is based purely on the logic of reason. 
 
Indeed, the liberal ideological attack has crippled the minds of the Muslim ummah. For they only resort to their intellect and logical reasoning in evaluating good deeds and wrongdoing, hence rejecting al-Qur’an and as-Sunnah as the very source of legislation. They truly believe that one committing evil deed is not guilty for as long as the intention is good. 
 
Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala mentions in verse 83 of soorah Aal-‘Imraan: 
 
 
“So is it other than the religion of Allah they desire, while to Him have submitted [all] those within the heavens and earth, willingly or by compulsion, and to Him they will be returned?” 
 
Blessed audience, 
 
Al-Qur’an and as-Sunnah are the primary sources for reference and creed for the Muslim ummah, and not just relying on the intellect alone, which is very limited. Al-Qur’an mentions various historical accounts of the previous nations that were punished for opposing the da‘wah work of the Messengers. Some had their land lifted up to the sky, turned upside down, and thrown down, crushing over them. Another nation was viciously struck with lightning, while there were those that were turned into monkeys and others. Let us ponder and truly realize upon the consequences and torment promised by Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala! 
 
Dear beloved audience, 
 
 	To end the Friday khutbah today, I call upon the Muslim ummah to the following: 
 
1.	The Muslim ummah must cling firmly upon the teachings of Islam, according to the creed of Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jamaa‘ah in the aspects of ‘aqeedah, Sharee‘ah, and akhlaaq. 
 
2.	The Muslim ummah must ensure that they are not deceived by liberal thinking that could corrupt their imaan and ‘aqeedah. 
 
3.	The Muslim ummah must always refer to al-Qur’an and as-Sunnah, and proven legislative sources, while not making interpretations that are purely based on the logic of reason. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.”

 “MORAL DECADENCE LEADS TO CALAMITY” 
 

Dear blessed Muslims, 
 
I remind myself and respected audience to strive in increasing our taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala by abiding all of His Commands and avoiding all of His prohibitions. Let us altogether accumulate as much provision possible for the Hereafter, and the best provision is taqwa. May we become among those having solid imaan (faith) and taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. 
 
Today, I would like to elaborate on a khutbah titled “MORAL DECADENCE 
LEADS TO CALAMITY.” 
 
 
Dear beloved Muslims, 
 
Moral degradation that is happening within the Muslim community nowadays is attributed to them being further away in their relationship with Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala, and because they have neglected the teachings brought by Rasulullah ﷺ. If left as is, it will become detrimental and leaves grave effect in the disintegration of the ummah and destruction of the nation.  
 
Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala mentions in verse 96 of soorah al-A‘raaf: 
  

                                                 
1 al-Israa’ 17:16 
“And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah, We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied 
[the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning.” 
 
Even more unfortunate, there are those within the Muslim ummah that seem to not possess firm conviction upon the truthfulness of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala by blatantly ignoring all warnings and threats from Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. Hence, they clearly manifest their attitude in denying and disputing the commands and prohibitions decreed by Allah. 
 	 
Respected audience, 
 
We must truly realize that defiance and disobedience towards Allah is not only by worshipping idols and deities, but it also includes not having certainty in the rulings and promises of Allah regarding the Last Day and rewards and punishment. 
 
Furthermore, some within the Muslim ummah today blatantly disregard the admonishments from the prophets and messengers, hence they continue to indulge in destruction and oppression. Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala mentions in verse 59 of soorah al-Qasas: 
 
  
“…And We would not destroy the cities except while their people were wrongdoers.” 
 
This verse explains that we are always in the observation of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala, the All-Aware and All-Seeing, whom had created us. Whatever calamity befalls mankind certainly has its reason, whether realized or not. What is of certain is that there is no calamity that befalls except that it is due to the oppression of mankind itself. 
 
The oppression referred to here is associating others (shirk) with Allah and all forms of disobedience and sins committed by mankind including leaving out salaah (prayer), zinaa (fornication), LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) orientation, consuming intoxication, gambling, exposing the ‘awrah, consuming ribaa (usury), and other mischiefs. 
 
It is even more saddening when a part of our society is willing to defend drug abuse, ribaa, consensual sex, and LGBT orientation as disobedience and sins that are personal in nature, and that legal actions cannot be taken upon its doers. 
 
Dear blessed Muslims, 
 
Verily, al-Qur’an has reminded us with stories of previous nations whom were destroyed for committing disobedience, oppression, and transgression towards Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala, as in the story of the people of Prophet Loot whom openly indulged in a perverted lifestyle that they were inflicted with severe torment, mentioned by Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala in verses 82-83 of soorah Hood: 
 

“So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, [which were]. Marked from your Lord. And Allah’s punishment is not from the wrongdoers [very] far.” 
 
Aside from that, pharaoh (Fir‘awn) with all of his pride and arrogance had claimed to be god, so Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala had drowned him along with his army in the sea. Similarly with the disobedience of the people of Prophet Nooh whom opposed all of the da‘wah efforts by their Prophet, that in the end they were all drowned by the great flood where no one had survived save those that were along with Prophet Nooh ‘Alayhi as-Salaam. 
 
Dear beloved audience, 
 
Let us stay away from sins and disobedience that can incur calamity and catastrophe. Let us not wait until disaster strike us all, and only then we’d regretfully become remorseful and penitent. This is because when sinful acts and disobedience become rampant, then it will incur catastrophe and calamity from Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala, as mentioned in a hadeeth where Zaynab bint Jahsh radiyAllaahu ‘anha had asked Rasulullah ﷺ:  
  
“‘O Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we be destroyed though amongst us 
there are pious people?’ He said, ‘Yes, if evil increases.’” 
  (al-Bukhaari)
 
Respected audience, 
 
Take heed, for not all catastrophes that occur are merely natural disasters. On the contrary, there are calamities that are sheer reminders from Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. Therefore, let us fully emulate the akhlaaq (mannerism) taught by Rasulullah ﷺ. Verily, he was sent to this earth to perfect noble akhlaaq by emulating the noble character of the Prophet ﷺ. It is truly hoped that there will be a life of peace and harmony for mankind. How true indeed that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was sent as mercy to the worlds. 
 
Dear blessed Muslims, 
 
To end the khutbah today, I would like to sincerely implore upon every single audience to derive lessons and recommendations as follows: 
 
1.	The Muslim ummah must have full certainty that abiding firmly upon the teachings of al-Qur’an and as-Sunnah will guarantee success and salvation in this world and the Hereafter. 
 
2.	The Muslim ummah must practice and preserve authentic teachings of Islam that was brought by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and succeeded by esteemed Muslim scholars.  
 
3.	The Muslim ummah must avoid and collectively unite in eradicating all disobediences that can destroy the ummah and country, as well as incurring calamity from Allah. 
 
“And [We destroyed] Qaaroon and Fir‘awn and Haamaan. And Moses had already come to them with clear evidences, and they were arrogant in the land, but they were not out runners [of Our punishment]. So each We seized for his sin; and among them were those upon whom We sent a storm of stones, and among them were those who were seized by the blast [from the sky], and among them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow, and among them were those whom We drowned. And Allah would not have wronged them, but it was they who were wronging themselves.”

Dear blessed audience, 
 
Once again, I would like to remind all of us to always have the taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala and realize that Islam teaches us to remain moderate in every actions and deeds. As Muslims, we are to manifest noble akhlaaq, having utmost personality and attitude for Rasulullah ﷺ was sent to perfect akhlaaq and as mercy for the entire mankind and the worlds. Therefore, let us always increase our salawaat and salaam upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala mentions:

 “ETIQUETTES IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA” 
 
  
Dear blessed Muslims, 
 
Let us altogether strive to increase our taqwa of Allah by fulfilling all of His Commands and avoiding all of His prohibitions. May we all become among those granted Allah’s Protection in the Hereafter. 
 
 Today I will discuss upon a khutbah titled “ETIQUETTES IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA.” 
 
 Before I proceed with the khutbah, I would like to remind fellow audience upon the message of Rasulullah ﷺ to fully concentrate on the khutbah that is being delivered and not speak to anyone, as well as performing deeds that are in vain. This includes using the mobile phone while the khateeb is delivering the khutbah. 
 
Respected audience, 
 
 The social media nowadays has become an alternative medium in communicating with others. It has enabled some to reconnect with old friends after not having met for many years. Some are making new friends and even discovering new cultures, business opportunities, and a plethora of information. 
 
Almost each and every single one of us possess a social media account that is utilized for various tasks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and many more. Moreover, many would spend most of their time on social media. The statistics have revealed that up until June 2017, a total of 19 million Malaysians have Facebook accounts. 
 
 This clearly indicates that Malaysians are among active users in the usage of the social media. However, in our excitement while indulging in social media, there are rules and etiquettes that we must adhere to as Muslims that truly believe in Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. Among them: 
 
	1. 	Conveying good messages. 
 
                                                 
1 Qaaf 50:18 
Social media websites serve as a platform for us to convey beneficial messages for such deed will earn good rewards. This coincides with the hadeeth of Prophet Muhamad ﷺ, narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah radiyAllaahu ‘anh:  
 
“Whoever calls to guidance, then he receives the reward similar to the reward of whoever follows him.” 
(Muslim) 
  
Therefore, we must avoid and stop committing evil deeds such as slandering, inciting others, opening up fake accounts to humiliate and degrade others, sending messages with obscenities, that it would all lead to conflicts and disputes amongst mankind. Such evil deed is a sin that must be avoided. 
  
	2. 	Verify that it is saheeh (authentic) before dissemination. 
 
We as consumers of the social media must always ensure the authenticity of the piece of information received before disseminating it to others. Verifying its authenticity is an obligation and responsibility upon each individual. Even though the writing is not our own work, but we will remain sinful for spreading it. This reminder was explained by Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala in verse 18 of soorah Qaaf that was mentioned earlier in the khutbah, which means: 
 
“Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record].” 
 
Even our Prophet, Muhammad ﷺ, had reminded us through his hadeeth that was narrated by Abu Hurayrah radiyAllaahu ‘anh, where Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The servant speaks words that he does not understand its repercussions but he sinks down in Hell-Fire farther than the distance between the east and the west.” 
(Agreed Upon) 
 
3.	Observing the boundaries of interaction. 
 
While we are preoccupied with the excitement of reconnecting with old friends and meeting new ones, there are boundaries that must be observed. Ikhtilaat or interacting with non-mahrams that is overboard is a matter that we must take seriously so as to avoid harm that may occur later on. 
 
When communicating via social websites, let us avoid from becoming too intimate that it can create fitnah and ruin the relationship within the household. Let us ensure that whatever that needs to be conveyed is communicated clearly and explicitly, also direct to its intended meaning. 
 
As a result of unrestricted communications when utilizing the social media, it is worried that there will be grave effects upon the heart, which would lead to corrupted akhlaaq. Hence, let us place limitations upon our interactions on social websites according to our level best.   
 
4.	Protecting the dignity of others. 
 
Some of us are truly obsessed with the current trend that indirectly exposes the faults of others in their writing or when sharing article with others. Even worse is when our spouse’s faults or shortcomings are exposed to the public without us even being aware of it. 
 
Therefore, we have been commanded to protect and not expose the faults of others as mentioned in the hadeeth of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar radiyAllaahu ‘anhuma, where the Prophet ﷺ said:  مَِنِْ سَتَرَ مُسِْ لماً سَتَرَِهُ اللهُِ يَوِْمَ الِْ قيَامَ ةِ
“Whoever covers up the fault of a Muslim, Allah will cover up his fault on the Day of Resurrection.” 
 (al-Bukhaari) 
 
Dear respected audience, 
 
In addition to the etiquettes mentioned, as social media users, we must be truly wise in choosing the suitable time to communicate. Avoid indulging in social media when the khateeb is delivering the Friday khutbah, while eating, driving, interacting with family members, and right after completing the salaah that there’s even no time for dhikr and supplication.   
 
The adab of using social media is not intended to restrict individual freedom. 
However, it is to ensure that we will successfully become Muslims having utmost taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala, hence manifesting the true image as Muslims possessing noble akhlaaq.  
 
As Muslims, we are all agents in spreading good to all walks of society. Let us emulate our beloved Prophet ﷺ whom interacted with his own people with respect, even though they openly opposed him. Let us emulate him whom befriended his Companions and maintained good friendship with the non-Muslims. Let us emulate him whom interacted with the womenfolk with honor and dignity. Verily, in him (ﷺ) we find excellent exemplary that are to be emulated by all of us. 
 
Respected audience, 
 
To end today’s khutbah, let us altogether derive important lessons from the khutbah, among them: 
 
1.	The Muslim ummah must have certainty that every action and deeds will be questioned and held accountable by Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala in the Hereafter. 
 
2.	The Muslim ummah must utilize and benefit from the social media on beneficial matters only. 
 
3.	The Muslim ummah must protect and not disgrace others under any circumstances. 
 
4.	The Muslim ummah is prohibited from spreading information that has yet to be verified of is truthfulness or authenticity. 
 
	
“O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice. He will [then] amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment.”

 “THE OBLIGATION OF REPAYING THE DEBT” 
 

Dear blessed Muslims, 
 
Today, I would like to implore upon fellow audience to altogether strive in increasing our taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala by diligently performing all of His Commands and avoiding all of His prohibitions. By doing so, may we all be spared from the punishment of Hellfire and the wrath of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala. 
 
Let us internalize upon today’s khutbah titled “THE OBLIGATION OF REPAYING 
THE DEBT.” 
 
Dear blessed audience, 
 
Taking a loan (debt) is a form of mu‘ammalaat (social and economic dealings) that is allowed by the Islamic Sharee‘ah to its adherents in facilitating their daily affairs. There are several conditions that have been stipulated by Muslim scholars upon the debtor and creditor so that such provision that is allowed in Islam does not get abused. Islam deems debt as a practice that is permissible when there arises genuine need and significance. However, Islam does not encourage for a person to be in debt if the intention is solely to live with pleasure and luxury. Rasulullah ﷺ had supplicated to Allah asking for protection from the burden of being in debt, as mentioned in the hadeeth of ‘A’ishah radiyAllaahu ‘anha: 
 

Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) used to invoke Allah in the prayer saying, “O Allah, I seek refuge with you from all sins, and from being in debt.” Someone said, “O Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ)! (I see you) very often you seek refuge with Allah from being in debt.” He replied, “If a person is in debt, he tells lies when he speaks, and breaks his promises when he promises.” 
                                                 
1 al-Baqarah 2:280 
 (al-Bukhaari) 
 
Rasulullah’s invocation indicates to us how being in debt is a practice that is unhealthy if it is not properly managed, for it can cause the debtor to lie when speaking and breaks his promise after making them. Hence, it behooves us as the Muslim ummah to avoid it according to our level best. 
 
Dear blessed Muslims, 
 
Lately, we notice that living with debt is becoming the norm for some within today’s society. Even more saddening are those that are financially sound, and yet they opted to be in debt, with the presumption that it is the best approach in attaining profit and wealth. Such negative presumption has resulted in many individuals whom are financially capable in completing purchases in cash, but yet prefers to remain in debt for their purchase and sale transactions even though it only involves their grocery and household needs. They pursued that route thinking that cash payment will lead to loss and difficulty. 
 
Looking at the lifestyle of consumers today, one of the hot issues relating to consumerism is the new form within the debt culture, namely the usage of credit card. Findings from the Malaysian Department of Insolvency revealed that young executives are also among those caught in the declaration of bankruptcy due to their failure in paying off their credit card debt. 
 
This predicament is truly worrying and must be given serious attention given the fact that these young individuals are within the productive age group. For sure, many consumers nowadays are grappling with credit card debt problems for not thinking far ahead and easily duped by the “temporary pleasure” promised by those plastic, electronic cards. Credit card facilities are no longer only available at hypermarkets, but now include restaurants and clothing stores. Consumers are easily deceived by sale promotions that they become unaware in going excessive with their credit card purchases, only to entrap themselves in the end. These type of consumers are likened as those that “do not measure their garments’ on their own bodies” when spending (meaning: living beyond their means). 
 
Blessed audience, 
 
A portion of the Muslim ummah nowadays does not take heavy precaution regarding the repayment of their debt. Therefore, we find many debtors that refuse to pay off their debt. For example, educational, housing, and car loans, loans from companies or personal loans, and unpaid rental payments. Moreover, there are those that deem paying off those debts as something trivial and insignificant. Unfortunately, some are even willing to be deemed as bankrupt for as long as they do not have to pay back those accumulated debts. 
 
Let us altogether ponder upon the hadeeth of the Prophet ﷺ, narrated by Abu Hurayrah radiyAllaahu ‘anh: 
 

 
“It is an act of oppression on the part of a [financially able] person to procrastinate in fulfilling his obligation.” 
 (al-Bukhaari) 
 
Rasulullah ﷺ had also described regarding those that refuse to settle their debts. In the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah radiyAllaahu ‘anh, Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

 
“Whoever takes the money of the people with the intention of repaying it, Allah will repay it on his behalf, and whoever takes it in order to spoil it, then Allah will spoil him.”  
(al-Bukhaari) 
 
Do we not remember how Rasulullah would refuse to perform the funeral prayer upon those that did not settle their debts? Even though some ‘ulamaa’ (scholars) opined that this reluctance by Rasulullah had occurred during the early days of Islam, but it still manifests the importance and emphasis on the issue of debt in Islam. Not only that, even the martyrs, whom were willing to sacrifice their wealth and soul for Islam, will not be spared from this obligation if they still have unsettled debt. 
 
In the hadeeth of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr radiyAllaahu ‘anhuma, Rasulullah ﷺ said:   يُغْفَرُ  لل اش هي د كُلُّ ذَنْبٍ  إالَّ ال اديْنَِ 
“All the sins of a shaheed (martyr) are forgiven except debt.” 
(Muslim) 
 
Therefore, let us fully realize upon the significance for everyone to repay their own debts, whether to the country, individuals, and others, for the sake of safeguarding the interest of the society, religion, and nation. 
 
Beloved audience, 
 
To end the khutbah today, let us derive several essential points as guidelines for all of us, namely: 
 
1.	The Muslim ummah must have full certainty that those that intentionally do not repay the debts accumulated will be held accountable and responsible before Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala in the Hereafter. 
 
2.	The Muslim ummah must fully comprehend that taking a loan is a form of mu‘ammalaat in Islam that has its own conditions that are waajib (obligatory) to be fulfilled, in order to avoid retribution in the Hereafter. 
 
3.	The Muslim ummah must comprehend and remain cognizant that incurring debt without justified reasoning will cause its doer to plunge into perdition. 
 

“But yes, whoever fulfills his commitment and fears Allah - then indeed, Allah 
loves those who fear Him.” 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	(Aal-‘Imraan 3:76)

 THE SECOND KHUTBAH 

 
 
Dear blessed audience, 
 
Once again, I would like to remind all of us to always have the taqwa of Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala and realize that Islam teaches us to remain moderate in every actions and deeds. As Muslims, we are to manifest noble akhlaaq, having utmost personality and attitude for Rasulullah ﷺ was sent to perfect akhlaaq and as mercy for the entire mankind and the worlds. Therefore, let us always increase our salawaat and salaam upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Allah Subhaanahu Wa Ta‘aala mentions: 
 
“Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask 
[Allah to grant him] peace.” 
(al-Ahzaab 33:56) 
 

O Allah, You are the Lord that is All Mighty, we are grateful to You for having bestowed upon us rahmah and ni‘mah, that we are able to continue the effort in empowering the Muslim ummah, as an advanced state, prosperous and providing welfare, under the auspices and leadership of our Ruler as the Head of Islamic affairs in this state. 
 
Hence, we sincerely beseech You, O Allah, strengthen our imaan and creed according to that of Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jamaa‘ah, accept our righteous deeds, cultivate our soul with good mannerisms, unite our hearts, bestow upon us rizq with blessings, enrich us with beneficial knowledge, protect us from disasters and save us from teachings that are outside the fold of Islam such as Qadiyaani, deviant teachings such as Shee‘ah, and other teachings deemed as deviating from Islamic teachings or contradicting the creed of Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jamaa‘ah. O Allah, open up our hearts in performing the five daily prayers, fulfilling zakaat through Lembaga Zakat Selangor (Selangor Zakaat Board), making waqf and infaaq of our wealth to Perbadanan Wakaf Negeri Selangor (Selangor Waqf Corporation), and Tabung Amanah Pembangunan Islam Selangor (Islamic Development Trust Fund of Selangor).
